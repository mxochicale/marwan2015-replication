Replicating of RP of the first chapter of Recurrence Quantification Analysis (2015).



Dear Norbert and Charles,

I am trying to replicate the figure 1.1 and figure 1.2 of the first chapter
of Recurrence Quantification Analysis (2015).

# Figure 1.1: 
Although I am using the same controlling parameters for the lorenz system, I get 
a different pattern in the recurrence plot(RP) which is created using embedding parameter (m=1, tau=1) 
and epsilon=5. This is the graphical result:

# Figure 1.2: 
I understand that giving detailed description of the time series to create the RP is not relevant for the chapter,
but I am failing to replicate your results. 
I am interested having more understanding and knowing which functions and equations that you use to create the time series, 
specially for the logistic map equation which is not even closer to your results.

Finally, I would like to know if you are aware of any validation or standarisation test or publication for the creation of Recurrence Plots.
It seems that my graphical results might differt slightly from yours which might lead to different conclusions.


I am using R and the R package: `https://github.com/constantino-garcia/nonlinearTseries` for replication 
of the figures and the code is available [here](https://github.com/mxochicale/marwan2015-replication/tree/master/code).


Regards,
Miguel
