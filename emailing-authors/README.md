Dear NOrbert and Chuck,

I do appreciate your replies and your code which have helped me 
to have better understanding of the RPs and replicate most of your graphical results
* replicated figure11-v01: 
* replicated figure12-v01: 

However, with regard to the disrupted brownian motion, 
I understand that the RP should be equal to your results due the  use of rand() function
but I am expecting, at least, to have a similar using the same function and paremeters
for which so I did a slight change with the disputed parameter changing it from 
`2*rand-1` to `2*rand` and the epsilon parameter from 0.2 to 5 in the R version.


Additionally to that, I hope you have the time to reply the following questions:

* (1) What is your motivation to choose different time series legnths (e.g. 400 and 150) to create the RP?
* (2) I guess that every time series has its own features which might be the reason to choose
different threshold parameters (e.g. epsilon=0.2 and epsilon=0.4), however I am failing 
to understand the main reason for that. Would you explain more about your motivations?

* (3)Is there any fundamental reason to choose those particular time series inputs with those parameters:
(3.1) periodic(super-positioned harmonic oscillations): `sin(.2*[1:N]').*sin(.05*[1:N]')`
(3.2) logistic map corrupted with a linear increasing term:  `logistic.map.time.series  +  0.01*(1:(1+M)) with x=.617 
(3.3) distupted brownian motion:  `x(i+1)=x(i)+(2 ** rand-1)`

* (4) Are aware of any validation or standarisation test or publication for the creation of Recurrence Plots.
My silly assumption is that using either your matlab function `crp()` or the R package: `https://github.com/constantino-garcia/nonlinearTseries` 
must lead us to get the same results, however, you might your algorithm implementation might be a 
slightly different from the implemantation of Constantino-Garcia et al.
 

NOTE: It will take me some time but I want to let you know that I want submit 
this little exercise of replicating your graphical results to ReScience*

* ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and 
encourages the explicit replication of already published research, 
promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that 
the original research is reproducible. https://rescience.github.io/

Thanks again for your time and help
Miguel

Hi Miguel,

thanks for your interest in our work.

I will send you the scripts that I had used to prepare these figures. (I’m sorry that it is not well-commented)

Some remarks:
(1) For RP of Lorenz, the trajectory of the Lorenz system is used as shown in subpanel A, i.e., all three components x, y, and z of Lorenz are used.
(2) For chaotic systems, the choice of the initial value is crucial. Therefore, your logistic map differs. You can find the used value in the attached script.

If you have any further question let me know.

Best wishes
NOrbert

Dear Miguel - Thank you for your important questions.  
I defer to Norbert because Figs. 1.1 and 1.2 from our RQA book are generated by him.  
I note that your second link for Fig. 1.2 does not work for me. - Sincerely, Chuck 04/26/18

Replicating of RP of the first chapter of Recurrence Quantification Analysis (2015).

Dear Norbert and Charles,

I am trying to replicate the figure 1.1 and figure 1.2 of the first chapter
of Recurrence Quantification Analysis (2015).

# Figure 1.1: 
Although I am using the same controlling parameters for the lorenz system, I get 
a different pattern in the recurrence plot(RP) which is created using embedding parameter (m=1, tau=1) 
and epsilon=5. This is the graphical result:

Replicated Figure: https://github.com/mxochicale/marwan2015-replication/blob/master/figures/figure11/figure11-v00.png

# Figure 1.2: 
I understand that giving detailed description of the time series to create the RP is not relevant for the chapter,
but I am failing to replicate your results. 
I am interested having more understanding and knowing which functions and equations that you use to create the time series, 
specially for the logistic map equation which is not even closer to your results.

Replicated Figure: https://github.com/mxochicale/marwan2015-replication/blob/master/figures/figure12/figure12-v00.png


Finally, I would like to know if you are aware of any validation or standarisation test or publication for the creation of Recurrence Plots.
It seems that my graphical results might differt slightly from yours which might lead to different conclusions.


I am using R and the R package: `https://github.com/constantino-garcia/nonlinearTseries` for replication 
of the figures and the code is available [here](https://github.com/mxochicale/marwan2015-replication/tree/master/code).


Regards,
Miguel
