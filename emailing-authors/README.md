Hi Miguel,

thanks for your interest in our work.

I will send you the scripts that I had used to prepare these figures. (I’m sorry that it is not well-commented)

Some remarks:
(1) For RP of Lorenz, the trajectory of the Lorenz system is used as shown in subpanel A, i.e., all three components x, y, and z of Lorenz are used.
(2) For chaotic systems, the choice of the initial value is crucial. Therefore, your logistic map differs. You can find the used value in the attached script.

If you have any further question let me know.

Best wishes
NOrbert

Dear Miguel - Thank you for your important questions.  
I defer to Norbert because Figs. 1.1 and 1.2 from our RQA book are generated by him.  
I note that your second link for Fig. 1.2 does not work for me. - Sincerely, Chuck 04/26/18

Replicating of RP of the first chapter of Recurrence Quantification Analysis (2015).

Dear Norbert and Charles,

I am trying to replicate the figure 1.1 and figure 1.2 of the first chapter
of Recurrence Quantification Analysis (2015).

# Figure 1.1: 
Although I am using the same controlling parameters for the lorenz system, I get 
a different pattern in the recurrence plot(RP) which is created using embedding parameter (m=1, tau=1) 
and epsilon=5. This is the graphical result:

# Figure 1.2: 
I understand that giving detailed description of the time series to create the RP is not relevant for the chapter,
but I am failing to replicate your results. 
I am interested having more understanding and knowing which functions and equations that you use to create the time series, 
specially for the logistic map equation which is not even closer to your results.

Replicated Figure: https://github.com/mxochicale/marwan2015-replication/blob/master/figures/figure12/figure12-v00.png


Finally, I would like to know if you are aware of any validation or standarisation test or publication for the creation of Recurrence Plots.
It seems that my graphical results might differt slightly from yours which might lead to different conclusions.


I am using R and the R package: `https://github.com/constantino-garcia/nonlinearTseries` for replication 
of the figures and the code is available [here](https://github.com/mxochicale/marwan2015-replication/tree/master/code).


Regards,
Miguel
